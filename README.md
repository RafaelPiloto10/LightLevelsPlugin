# Minecraft Light Level Plugin
See which blocks are below a certain light level threshold! Useful if you want to know if mobs can spawn on a block because it is too dark!

# Installation
Drop the `.jar` file in your plugins folder and setup the `config.yml` if you want to customize the light level!

# Usage
* `/lightlevels see <optional:threshold>` - Spawns armor stands on blocks that are below the threshold - default is in `config.yml`
* `/lightlevels hide` - Removes any nearby armor stand (MAY REMOVE ARMOR STANDS NOT SPAWNED BY PLUGIN)

# Configuration
* `default-level` - The threshold at which an armor stand should spawn - default is 7

## Permissions
* `lightlevels.use` - Can the player use the commands
